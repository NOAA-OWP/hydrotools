        Args:
            bbox: Only features that have a geometry that intersects the bounding box
                are selected.The bounding box is provided as four or six numbers,
                depending on whether the coordinate reference system includes a
                vertical axis (height or depth).
            bbox_crs: Indicates the coordinate reference system for the given bbox
                coordinates.
            begin: The datetime of the earliest observation in the time series. Together
                with `end_utc`, this field represents the period of record of a time
                series. Note that some time series may have large gaps in their
                collection record.
                You can query this field using date-times or intervals, adhering to
                RFC 3339, or using ISO 8601 duration objects. Intervals may be bounded
                or half-bounded (double-dots at start or end).
                Examples:

                  - A date-time: "2018-02-12T23:20:50Z"
                  - A bounded interval: "2018-02-12T00:00:00Z/2018-03-18T12:31:12Z"
                  - Half-bounded intervals: "2018-02-12T00:00:00Z/.." or
                "../2018-03-18T12:31:12Z"
                  - Duration objects: "P1M" for data from the past month or "PT36H"
                for the last 36 hours

                Only features that have a `begin_utc` that intersects the value of
                datetime are selected.
            crs: Indicates the coordinate reference system for the results.
            end: The datetime of the most recent observation in the time series. Data
                returned by this endpoint updates at most once per day, and
                potentially less frequently than that, and as such there may be more
                recent observations within a time series than the time series
                `end_utc` value reflects. Together with `begin_utc`, this field
                represents the period of record of a time series. It is additionally
                used to determine whether a time series is "active".
                You can query this field using date-times or intervals, adhering to
                RFC 3339, or using ISO 8601 duration objects. Intervals may be bounded
                or half-bounded (double-dots at start or end).
                Examples:

                  - A date-time: "2018-02-12T23:20:50Z"
                  - A bounded interval: "2018-02-12T00:00:00Z/2018-03-18T12:31:12Z"
                  - Half-bounded intervals: "2018-02-12T00:00:00Z/.." or
                "../2018-03-18T12:31:12Z"
                  - Duration objects: "P1M" for data from the past month or "PT36H"
                for the last 36 hours

                Only features that have a `end_utc` that intersects the value of
                datetime are selected.
            f: The optional f parameter indicates the output format which the server
                shall provide as part of the response document.  The default format is
                GeoJSON.
            lang: The optional lang parameter instructs the server return a response in
                a certain language, if supported.  If the language is not among the
                available values, the Accept-Language header language will be used if
                it is supported. If the header is missing, the default server language
                is used. Note that providers may only support a single language (or
                often no language at all), that can be different from the server
                language.  Language strings can be written in a complex (e.g. "fr-
                CA,fr;q=0.9,en-US;q=0.8,en;q=0.7"), simple (e.g. "de") or locale-like
                (e.g. "de-CH" or "fr_BE") fashion.
            last_modified: The last time a record was refreshed in our database. This may happen
                due to regular operational processes and does not necessarily indicate
                anything about the measurement has changed.
                You can query this field using date-times or intervals, adhering to
                RFC 3339, or using ISO 8601 duration objects. Intervals may be bounded
                or half-bounded (double-dots at start or end).
                Examples:

                  - A date-time: "2018-02-12T23:20:50Z"
                  - A bounded interval: "2018-02-12T00:00:00Z/2018-03-18T12:31:12Z"
                  - Half-bounded intervals: "2018-02-12T00:00:00Z/.." or
                "../2018-03-18T12:31:12Z"
                  - Duration objects: "P1M" for data from the past month or "PT36H"
                for the last 36 hours

                Only features that have a `last_modified` that intersects the value of
                datetime are selected.
            limit: The optional limit parameter limits the number of items that are
                presented in the response document (maximum=50000, default=10).
            monitoring_location_id: A unique identifier representing a single monitoring location. This
                corresponds to the `id` field in the `monitoring-locations` endpoint.
                Monitoring location IDs are created by combining the agency code of
                the agency responsible for the monitoring location (e.g. USGS) with
                the ID number of the monitoring location (e.g. 02238500), separated by
                a hyphen (e.g. USGS-02238500).
                 Split parameters are enabled for this field, so you can supply
                multiple values separated by commas.
            offset: The optional offset parameter indicates the index within the result
                set from which the server shall begin presenting results in the
                response document.  The first element has an index of 0 (default).
            parameter_code: Parameter codes are 5-digit codes used to identify the constituent
                measured and the units of measure. A complete list of parameter codes
                and associated groupings can be found at
                [https://api.waterdata.usgs.gov/ogcapi/v0/collections/parameter-codes/
                items](https://api.waterdata.usgs.gov/ogcapi/v0/collections/parameter-
                codes/items).
                 Split parameters are enabled for this field, so you can supply
                multiple values separated by commas.
            parameter_description: A description of what the parameter code represents, as used by WDFN
                and other USGS data dissemination products.
            parameter_name: A human-understandable name corresponding to `parameter_code`.
            properties: The properties that should be included. The parameter value is a
                comma-separated list of property names.
            query_filter: CQL Text filter expression.  CQL JSON cannot be used here, only in the
                body.
                See also: https://docs.pygeoapi.io/en/latest/cql.html

                Example: time_series_id IN ('64ee32f5350a4ec4967435dcd2e364ea',
                '3e55d9c2d8a54bec9ca5e292b07d5a96')
            query_id: A unique identifier representing a single collection series. This
                corresponds to the `field_measurement_series_id` field in the `field-
                measurements` endpoint. Collection series are defined as the set of
                field measurements at a given monitoring location for a single
                parameter code using a single reading type.
                 Split parameters are enabled for this field, so you can supply
                multiple values separated by commas.
            skipgeometry: This option can be used to skip response geometries for each feature.
            sortby: Specifies a comma-separated list of property names by which the
                response shall be sorted.  If the property name is preceded by a plus
                (+) sign it indicates an ascending sort for that property.  If the
                property name is preceded by a minus (-) sign it indicates a
                descending sort for that property.  If the property is not preceded by
                a plus or minus, then the default sort order implied is ascending (+).

                Only a single page of data can be returned when specifying sortby. If
                you need more than a single page of data, don't specify a sortby value
                and sort the full data set after it's been downloaded.
