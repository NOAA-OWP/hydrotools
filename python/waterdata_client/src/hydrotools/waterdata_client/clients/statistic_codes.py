        Args:
            bbox: Only features that have a geometry that intersects the bounding box
                are selected.The bounding box is provided as four or six numbers,
                depending on whether the coordinate reference system includes a
                vertical axis (height or depth).
            bbox_crs: Indicates the coordinate reference system for the given bbox
                coordinates.
            crs: Indicates the coordinate reference system for the results.
            f: The optional f parameter indicates the output format which the server
                shall provide as part of the response document.  The default format is
                GeoJSON.
            lang: The optional lang parameter instructs the server return a response in
                a certain language, if supported.  If the language is not among the
                available values, the Accept-Language header language will be used if
                it is supported. If the header is missing, the default server language
                is used. Note that providers may only support a single language (or
                often no language at all), that can be different from the server
                language.  Language strings can be written in a complex (e.g. "fr-
                CA,fr;q=0.9,en-US;q=0.8,en;q=0.7"), simple (e.g. "de") or locale-like
                (e.g. "de-CH" or "fr_BE") fashion.
            limit: The optional limit parameter limits the number of items that are
                presented in the response document (maximum=50000, default=10000).
            offset: The optional offset parameter indicates the index within the result
                set from which the server shall begin presenting results in the
                response document.  The first element has an index of 0 (default).
            properties: The properties that should be included. The parameter value is a
                comma-separated list of property names.
            query_filter: CQL Text filter expression.  CQL JSON cannot be used here, only in the
                body.
                See also: https://docs.pygeoapi.io/en/latest/cql.html

                Example: time_series_id IN ('64ee32f5350a4ec4967435dcd2e364ea',
                '3e55d9c2d8a54bec9ca5e292b07d5a96')
            query_id: Statistic code.
            skipgeometry: This option can be used to skip response geometries for each feature.
            sortby: Specifies a comma-separated list of property names by which the
                response shall
                be sorted.  If the property name is preceded by a plus (+) sign it
                indicates
                an ascending sort for that property.  If the property name is preceded
                by a
                minus (-) sign it indicates a descending sort for that property.  If
                the
                property is not preceded by a plus or minus, then the default sort
                order
                implied is ascending (+).
            statistic_description: Statistic description.
            statistic_name: Statistic name.
